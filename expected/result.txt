12: Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, 
15: And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: 
16: Streets that follow like a tedious argument 
17: Of insidious intent 
20: Let us go and make our visit. 
32: Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. 
67: Beneath the music from a farther room.

144: I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. 
147: I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. 
157: Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
